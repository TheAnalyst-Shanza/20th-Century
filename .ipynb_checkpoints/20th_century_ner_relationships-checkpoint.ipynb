      " 15: [p] The new beginning of the 20th century marked significant changes. The 1900s saw the decade herald a series of inventions, including the automobile , airplane and radio broadcasting . 1914 saw the completion of the Panama Canal .\n",
      " 16: [p] From 1914 to 1918, the First World War, and its aftermath, caused major changes in the power balance of the world, destroying or transforming some of the most powerful empires.\n",
      " 17: [p] The First World War (or simply WWI), termed \"The Great War\" by contemporaries, started in July 1914 and ended in November 1918. The war was precipitated by the Assassination in Sarajevo of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 's heir to the throne, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand , by Gavrilo Princip , a member of the Young Bosnia liberation movement. After a period of diplomatic and military escalation known as the July Crisis , by the end of July 1914 two coalitions were at war: the Allies, comprised initially of the British Empire , France , and the Russian Empire ; and the Central Powers , comprised initially of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\n",
      " 18: [p] In 1917, Russia ended hostile actions against the Central Powers after the fall of the Tsar. The Bolsheviks negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, although it was a huge cost to Russia. In the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded the Baltic states to Germany, and its province of Kars Oblast in the South Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire . It also recognized the independence of Ukraine . [ 3 ] Although Germany shifted huge forces from the eastern to the western front after signing the treaty, it was unable to stop the Allied advance, especially with the entrance of American troops in 1918. [ 4 ]\n",
      " 19: [p] When the war was finally over in 1918, the results would set the stage for the next twenty years. First and foremost, the Germans were forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles , forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War. Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually \"lose\" the war nor did they feel they caused the war (see Stab-in-the-back legend ). [ 10 ] Germany was never occupied by Allied troops, yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm . [ 11 ]\n",
      " 20: [p] From 1918 to 1920, a remarkably deadly worldwide pandemic caused by the flu broke out near the end of the war and spread globally. Estimates range from anywhere between 17 to 100 million deaths, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] which staples it as the deadliest pandemic in human history . One of the reasons for the exceptionally high carnage was that wartime censorship was underway to preserve morale in the trenches, leading to poor hygiene. Combined with already existing malnourishment and overcrowded medical facilities, this mix made it all the more deadly. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]\n",
      " 21: [p] The Russian Revolution of 1917 (ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the execution of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II and his family) sparked a wave of communist revolutions across Europe, prompting many to believe that a socialist world revolution could be realized in the near future. [ 19 ] However, the European revolutions were defeated, Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, and within a few years, Joseph Stalin displaced Leon Trotsky as the de facto leader of the Soviet Union . The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront, as Stalin concentrated on \" socialism in one country \" [ 20 ] and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization. [ 21 ] The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin's autocratic rule, his purges and the assassination of his \"enemies\", as well as the news of famines he imposed on his own people. [ 22 ]\n",
      " 22: [p] Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in 1929 in what became known as the Great Depression . Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis, especially as the Soviet Union's economic development in the 1930s was strong, unaffected by the capitalist world's crisis. [ 23 ]\n",
      " 23: [p] Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in 1922. [ 28 ] The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism. [ 29 ]\n",
      " 24: [p] When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, a new variant of fascism called Nazism took over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy. The Nazi Party in Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige, the unification of German-speaking peoples, and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states, with the Slavic population to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests. [ 30 ] There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity (the idea that Germans were the Herrenvolk or the \"master race\"), and a vicious antisemitism which promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman ( Untermensch ) and worthy only of extermination. [ 31 ]\n",
      " 25: [p] Hitler began to put his plan in motion, annexing Austria in the Anschluss , or reunification of Austria to Germany, in 1938. [ 34 ] He then negotiated the annexation of the Sudetenland , a German-speaking mountainous area of Czechoslovakia , in the Munich Conference . [ 35 ] The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler's assurance to protect the security of the Czech state. Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards, indicating that he had ulterior motives. [ 36 ]\n",
      " 26: [p] Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia, Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland, which seemed to be next on Hitler's list. World War II officially began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler unleashed his Blitzkrieg , or lightning war, against Poland. Britain and France, much to Hitler's surprise, immediately declared war upon Germany, but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible. [ 39 ] Sixteen days later, Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union, acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany. [ 40 ] After only a few weeks, the Polish forces were overwhelmed, and its government fled to exile in London (see Polish government in Exile ).\n",
      " 27: [p] As Hitler's forces conquered Poland, the Soviet Union , under General Secretary Joseph Stalin , was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of a nonaggression pact between the USSR and Germany known as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact . This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics of Estonia , Latvia, and Lithuania , as well as Eastern Poland, all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war. [ 42 ] Stalin also launched an attack on Finland, which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state, but the Red Army met staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as the Winter War and succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns. [ 43 ] This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in 1941. [ 44 ]\n",
      " 28: [p] After the defeat of Poland, a period known as the Phony War ensued during the winter of 1939–1940, which saw only limited military land operation on the Western Front . [ 45 ] This changed when Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on 9 April 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only six hours . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies . [ 48 ] On the 10 May 1940, when the Germans launched a massive attack on the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg ), likely to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco-German border. [ 49 ] This witnessed the incredible fall of Eben Emael , a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by 600 Belgians, to a force of only 88 German paratroopers . The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on 28 May without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups. [ 50 ]\n",
      " 29: [p] With the disaster in the Low Countries, France, considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world, lasted only six weeks, with Paris being occupied on 14 June. Three days later, Marshal Philippe Pétain surrendered to the Germans. [ 51 ] The debacle in France also led to one of the war's greatest mysteries, and Hitler's first great blunder, Dunkirk , where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats, but every craft the army could find, including fishing boats. Hitler refused to \"risk\" his panzers on an action at Dunkirk, listening to the advice of Air Minister Hermann Göring and allowing the Luftwaffe , or German Air Force, to handle the job. [ 52 ] The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches of Normandy in 1944. Hitler did not occupy all of France, but about three-quarters, including all of the Atlantic coast, allowing Marshal Pétain to remain as dictator of an area known as Vichy France . [ 53 ] However, members of the escaped French Army formed around General Charles de Gaulle to create the Free French forces, which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France. [ 54 ] At this moment, Italy, under Benito Mussolini , declared war on the Allies on 10 June, thinking that the war was almost over, but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory. [ 55 ] Throughout the war, the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon, and would later cost them precious time in Greece. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\n",
      " 30: [p] Hitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain, which stood alone against him. He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion, code named Operation Sea Lion , and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles, which would come to be known as the Battle of Britain . The British at first suffered steady losses, but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany, taking down 2,698 German planes throughout the summer of 1940 to only 915 Royal Air Force (RAF) losses. [ 58 ] The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known as terror bombing using the distinctive \"bomb\" sound created by the German dive-bomber, the Stuka . [ 59 ] The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin. [ 60 ] Hitler was infuriated. However, his decision to switch the attacks' focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion. [ 61 ]\n",
      " 31: [p] Hitler, taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain, now turned his gaze eastward to the Soviet Union . Despite having signed the non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth. He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of 1941 to avoid the disastrous Russian winter. However, a pro-allied coup in Yugoslavia and Mussolini's almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied Albania prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time. [ 63 ] The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts; the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR, potentially hampering it. [ 64 ]\n",
      " 32: [p] On 22 June 1941, Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen . Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union. [ 65 ] Stalin had been warned about the attack, both by other countries and by his own intelligence network, but he had refused to believe it. Therefore, the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered massive setbacks in the early part of the war, despite Stalin's orders to counterattack the Germans. [ 66 ] Throughout 1941, German forces, divided into 3 army groups (Army Group A, Army Group B, and Army Group C), occupied the territories of the present day Ukraine and Belarus , laid siege to Leningrad (present day Saint Petersburg), and advanced to within 15 miles of Moscow. At this critical moment, the Soviet people stalled the German Wehrmacht to a halt at the gates of Moscow. Stalin had planned to evacuate the city, and had already moved important government functions, but decided to stay and rally the city. Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of Marshal Georgy Zhukov counterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow. [ 67 ]\n",
      " 33: [p] After the winter, Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of 1942, with the aim of capturing the oil-rich Caucacus and the city of Stalingrad . However, he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed. The offensive bogged down, and the entire 6th Army , considered the best of German troops, was trapped in Stalingrad. Hitler now refused to let 6th Army break out. He insisted that the German army would force its way in. Hermann Göring also assured Hitler that the Luftwaffe could supply the 6th Army adequately, when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the needed ammunition and rations . Eventually, the starved 6th Army surrendered, dealing a severe blow to the Germans. In the end, the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east. [ 71 ]\n",
      " 34: [p] Meanwhile, the Japanese had attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on 7 December 1941. This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war. Parts of the German brass advised against declaring war on the US, arguing that since Japan was the aggressor, the Tripartite Pact didn't bind Germany to do so. However, Hitler hoped that Japan would be able to quickly defeat the US and then turn its attention on helping the effort against Russia. Both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States a few days after the attack. [ 72 ]\n",
      " 35: [p] Throughout the rest of 1942 and 1943, the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans after some victories like the tank battle of Kursk . [ 73 ] By this time, Rommel had been forced to abandon North Africa after a defeat by Montgomery at El Alamein in what was the first decisive victory of the Allies over the Germany army, leading Churchill to declare it \" the end of the beginning \". [ 74 ] On several fronts, the Wehrmacht had encountered serious casualties that it could not replace. Hitler also insisted on a \"hold at all costs\" policy which forbade relinquishing any ground. He followed a \"fight to the last man\" policy that was completely ineffective. By the beginning of 1944, Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union, and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him. [ 75 ]\n",
      " 36: [p] From 1942 to 1944, the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater, much to the chagrin of Stalin. They drove out the Germans in Africa, invading Morocco and Algeria on 8 November 1942. [ 76 ] Then, on 10 July 1943, the Allies invaded Sicily , in preparation for an advance through Italy, the \"soft underbelly\" of the Axis, as Winston Churchill called it. On 9 September, the invasion of Italy began. [ 77 ] By the winter of 1943, the southern half of Italy was in Allied hands. The Italians, most of whom did not really support the war, had already turned against Mussolini. In July, he had been stripped of power and taken prisoner, though the Italians feigned continued support of the Axis. On 8 September, the Italians formally surrendered, [ 78 ] but most of Italy not in Allied hands was controlled by German troops and those loyal to Mussolini's (Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers) new Italian Social Republic , which in reality consisted of the shrinking zone of German control. The Germans offered staunch resistance, but by 4 June 1944, Rome had fallen. [ 79 ]\n",
      " 37: [p] The Battle of the Atlantic took place from 1942 to 1944 and was described as \"longest, largest, and most complex naval battle in history\". [ 80 ] The Germans hoped to sever the vital supply lines between Britain and America, sinking many tons of shipping with U-boats , German submarines. However, the development of the destroyer and aircraft with a longer patrol range were effective at countering the U-boat threat and by December 1943, the Germans had lost the battle. [ 81 ]\n",
      " 38: [p] On 6 June 1944, the Western Allies finally launched the long-awaited assault on \"Fortress Europe\" so wanted by Stalin. The offensive, codenamed Operation Overlord , began the early morning hours of 6 June. The day, known as D-Day , was marked by foul weather. Rommel, who was now in charge of defending France against possible Allied attack, thought the Allies would not attack during the stormy weather, and was on holiday in Germany. [ 82 ] Besides this, the Germans were expecting an attack, but at the natural harbor of Calais and not the beaches of Normandy ; They did not know about the Allies' artificial harbours , and false leads planted by the Allies suggested Calais as the landing site. [ 83 ]\n",
      " 39: [p] By this time, the war was looking ever darker for Germany. On 20 July 1944, a group of conspiring German officers attempted to assassinate Hitler. The bomb they used did injure him, but the second was not used, and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck. [ 84 ] The plotters still could have launched a coup, but only the head of occupied Paris acted, arresting SS and Gestapo forces in the city. The German propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels , rallied the Nazis and hunted down the conspirators, arresting up to 7000 people in the wake of the plot, according to some estimates. [ 85 ]\n",
      " 40: [p] In France, the Allies took Normandy and finally Paris on 25 August. [ 86 ] In the east, the Soviets had advanced almost to the former Polish-Soviet border. At this time, Hitler introduced the V-weapons , the V-1 flying bomb and, later, the V-2 , the first rockets used in modern warfare. The V-1 was often intercepted by air pilots, but the V-2 was extremely fast and carried a large payload. However, this advance came too late in the war to have any real effect. [ 87 ] The Germans were also on the verge of introducing a number of terrifying new weapons, including advanced jet aircraft, which were too fast for ordinary propeller aircraft, and submarine improvements which would allow the Germans to again fight effectively in the Atlantic. All this came too late to save Hitler. Although a September invasion of The Netherlands failed, the Allies made steady advances. In the winter of 1944, Hitler put everything into one last desperate gamble in the West, known as the Battle of the Bulge , which, despite an initial advance, was a failure, because the introduction of new Allied tanks and low troop numbers among the Germans prevented any real action being taken. Nevertheless, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the war and the second costliest battle in the history of the American Army . [ 88 ]\n",
      " 41: [p] In early February 1945, the three Allied leaders, Franklin Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , and Joseph Stalin , met at newly liberated Yalta in the Crimea in the Soviet Union in the Yalta Conference . [ 89 ] Here, they agreed upon a plan to divide post-war Europe. Most of the east went to Stalin, who agreed to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, which he never did. The west went to Britain, France, and the U.S. Post-war Germany would be split between the four, as would Berlin. This division of spheres of influence would set up international diplomacy for the Cold War that would dominate the second half of the century. [ 90 ]\n",
      " 42: [p] At the beginning of 1945, Hitler was on his last strings. The Soviets launched a devastating attack from Poland into Germany and Eastern Europe, intending to take Berlin. The Germans collapsed in the West, allowing the Allies to fan out across Germany. However, the Supreme Allied Commander, American general Dwight D. Eisenhower , refused to strike for Berlin, and instead became obsessed with reports of possible guerrilla activity in southern Germany, which in reality existed mainly in the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels. [ 91 ] By 25 April the Soviets had besieged Berlin. Hitler remained in the city in a bunker under the Chancellery garden. On 30 April he committed suicide by shooting himself, after a ritual wedding with his longtime mistress Eva Braun . [ 92 ] The Germans held out another 7 days under Admiral Doenitz , their new leader, but the Germans surrendered unconditionally on 7 May 1945, ending the war in Europe (see V-E Day ). [ 93 ]\n",
      " 43: [p] The first event that is usually linked to the later Pacific conflict was the Mukden Incident of 18 September 1931, during which the Japanese military staged the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway and pinned the blame on Chinese dissidents. [ 94 ] Japan then used this as pretext to invade northeastern China the next day and turn the region of Manchuria into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo . [ 95 ] After the League of Nations commissioned the 1932 Lytton Report , which exposed the Mukden Incident as a Japanese ruse, Japan was left internationally isolated, withdrawing from the League of Nations in March 1933. In 1934 Manchukuo became a constitutional monarchy and the former Chinese Emperor Pu Yi was placed on the throne, despite the real power being held by Japan. [ 96 ]\n",
      " 44: [p] Despite relations between Japan and China suffering because the occupation of Manchuria, the situation did not turn into all-out war until 7 July 1937, when a dispute between Chinese and Japanese soldiers turned into a battle during the Marco Polo Bridge Incident . [ 97 ] This, in turn, led to a further escalation of the hostilities, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War , one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. [ 98 ] Japan enjoyed some early major victories, capturing both Shanghai and the Chinese capital of Nanjing in 1937 and forcing the Chinese central government 's relocation to Chongqing . Following Chinese victories in Changsha and Guangxi in 1939, the war reached somewhat of a stalemate, with Japan controlling the large cities, but being unable to rule the vast countryside. [ 99 ] On 27 September 1940, Japan became cosignatories of the Tripartite Pact , joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy. [ 100 ]\n",
      " 45: [p] On 7 December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor as a mean of preventing the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned expansion in the area. [ 101 ] The next day, following Roosevelt's Infamy Speech , the United States declared war on Japan, marking the official entry of both nations in World War 2. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] At the same time, Japan also launched attacks on Thailand , the British colonies of Malaya , Singapore , Hong Kong and American military bases in Guam , Wake Island and the Philippines . [ 104 ]\n",
      " 46: [p] The next six months were dominated by Japanese victories against the Allied forces, already war-weary and stretched thin after two years of war in Europe and North Africa. Japan managed to capture British Burma , New Guinea , the Dutch East Indies , the Solomon Islands , Bali and Timor . [ 105 ] In March 1942, days before the surrender of the Philippines, general Douglas MacArthur, who came out of retirement to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East at the onset of the war, was forced to flee and narrowly escape to Australia. [ 106 ] On 19 February 1942, Japan also launched a devastating aerial attack on the Australian city of Darwin, in what was the first attack by a foreign power on Australian soil. [ 107 ]\n",
      " 47: [p] The turning of the tide came in early May, during the Battle of the Coral Sea , which proved the first strategic victory of the Allies against Japanese expansion. [ 108 ] This was followed one month later by the Battle of Midway , in which the US Navy defeated an attacking Japanese fleet, inflicting devastating damage on the attacking force. The Battle of Midway is widely considered the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign and has even been described as \"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare\" [ 109 ] The reasons usually given for the resounding victory are Japanese overconfidence in their own forces, poor planning and the intercepting of Japanese battle plans by the United States. [ 110 ] The losses suffered during this Battle of Midway, paired with the campaign of attrition that was taking place in Solomon Islands , left Japan unable to replenish its forces and turned the tides of war against it. By August 1942, the Allied forces were on the offensive, earning victories in the New Guinea campaign at Guadalcanal , Milne Bay and Buna-Gona . [ 111 ]\n",
      " 48: [p] Over the next two years the Allies slowly captured one island base after another, trying to get closer to Japan itself, where it planned to launch massive strategic air attacks and, only if absolutely necessary, execute a ground invasion. By July 1944, the US recaptured Guam and captured Tinian , which finally put them in attacking range of mainland Japan using the new Boeing B-29 bombers. [ 112 ] Despite the advances of the Allies, massive fighting was still taking place, both in South-East Asia with the Japanese offensive in India and in the Pacific, with the Battle of the Philippine Sea , where Japan suffered major losses and definitively lost the ability to rely on aircraft carriers . [ 113 ] In later October, a combined attack of American and Australian forces took on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in what was to be the largest naval battle of World War II and possibly the largest naval battle of all time . [ 114 ] The Allied victory achieved its stated goal of further severing oil supplied to the Japanese army, which was already struggling to fuel the remainder of its naval power. [ 115 ] The battle of Leyte Gulf is also notable as the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized kamikaze attacks. [ 116 ]\n",
      " 49: [p] By early 1945, the Americans set their eyes on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, which was of great strategic importance, being situated halfway between Tokyo and the Mariana Islands . Capturing the island meant not only a better launch station for aerial attacks against mainland Japan, but also the prevention of its use as an early-warning station against air raids. The Japanese were expecting an attack and have been heavily fortifying the entire island for over a year. [ 117 ] Despite the American troops outnumbering the Japanese to a rate of more than 3 to 1, the USA suffered heavy casualties in the 36 days of fighting, with over 6,800 Marines killed and another 20,000 wounded, [ 118 ] leading some historians to question the strategic worth of the action. [ 119 ] With Japan struggling to defend the homeland islands, counteroffensives in other parts of the Japanese Empire became more feasible, with important battles taking place in Burma , Borneo and China .\n",
      " 50: [p] Continuing to come nearer the main Japanese islands, on 1 April 1945 the US Marines mounted the largest amphibious assault of the Pacific Theater on the island of Okinawa . [ 120 ] After a long campaign of island hopping , the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall , the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands which were only 340 miles away. [ 121 ] The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides: at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166–117,000 Japanese. Around half of the island's population of 300,000 were killed, committed suicide or went missing. [ 122 ]\n"
